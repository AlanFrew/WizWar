WizWar currently only supports hotseat mode. You see two boards, one for each wizard, with their controls underneath.

The board is a labyrinth containing walls, doors, wizards, and treasure. The edges wrap around if there is no wall.

You have a hand of cards that represent spells and items. Select one and use the Cast button to activate it.

Spells have no cost, but you can only use one Attack spell per turn.

Some spells can accept a number to make it more powerful. Click the spell, click Cast, highlight a number, click Number.

You usually need Line of Sight to target something. LoS wraps around the board, but you can't shoot around/through a corner.

Whenever a spell is cast, each player is given priority to respond. The spell goes off once everyone clicks Continue.

You have limited movement, default 3. Use the arrow keys to move.

Press End Turn when you are finished moving and casting.

Item spells will create an item in your inventory.

You can pick up dropped items as well as treasures. This ends your turn.

You can only carry one treasure. Placing an opponent's treasure on your home square wins the game.

You have 15 life. Dying makes you lose.

The Spell Stack box will show what spells are currently attempting to cast.

If the game isn't responding, click Continue on both control panels, or End Turn.

Blue Wizard starts.

You can draw and discard at the end of your turn.

There is an LoSTester button you can use to determine what you can see/target.

You can query a wizard or Square for more info by opening the Show Info window and clicking Query Wizard or Query Square.

The map and various numerical settings can be changed by editing the file WizWar1.exe.config.
